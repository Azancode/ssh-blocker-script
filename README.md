# SSH Blocker ðŸ”’

A lightweight Bash script to automatically block IP addresses after multiple failed SSH login attempts.  
It monitors `/var/log/auth.log`, detects repeated failures, and adds the attackerâ€™s IP to `iptables` for protection.  

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Monitors SSH failed login attempts from `/var/log/auth.log`
- Blocks attacker IPs using `iptables`
- Custom logging of blocked IPs (`/var/log/ssh-blocker.log`)
- Simple and minimal â€“ no external dependencies like Fail2Ban
